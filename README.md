## 🧠 Pro Skill Expertise: The Cognitive Engine

Unlike standard template fillers, AI Resume Artisan utilizes a **Multi-Model Orchestration Layer** to act as an elite career coach.

### 1. Deep Semantic Reasoning (`gemini-3-pro-preview`)
The system doesn't just match keywords; it understands *context*.
*   **Executive Translation:** Converts "Managed a team" into "Orchestrated cross-functional operations driving 40% efficiency gains," aligning the tone with the seniority of the target role.
*   **Gap Analysis & Strategic Fixes:** Identifies specific missing hard/soft skills compared to the JD and *suggests the exact bullet point* to bridge that gap truthfully.
*   **Thinking Mode:** Utilizes extended token budgets to reason through complex career pivots and transferable skills.

### 2. Live Market Grounding (`gemini-2.5-flash` + Search)
*   **Real-Time Trends:** Injects 2025-relevant industry keywords by actively searching current market data, ensuring your resume never looks outdated.
*   **Tailoring Strength Score:** Provides a quantifiable 0-100% match score against your target Job Description.
