## 2. Crafting Your Resume

### Step 1: Core Strategy
1.  **Candidate Profile:** Paste your raw history—LinkedIn export, old CV text, or rough notes. The AI is smart enough to structure chaos.
2.  **Target Job (Crucial):** Paste the Job Description (JD) you are targeting.
3.  **Deep Grounding:** Click the **Search Icon** inside the JD box to let Gemini research real-time industry trends for that role. This injects 2025-relevant keywords into your profile.

### Step 2: Visual Identity
1.  **Template:** Choose **"Executive Suite (Gold)"** for banking/law/leadership, or **"Modern Tech"** for startups/engineering.
2.  **Typography:** Select Serif (Merriweather) for authority, or Sans (Inter) for clarity.
3.  **Headshot:** Click **"Generate 2K"** to create a professional AI headshot tailored to your role.

### Step 3: Initialize Generation
Click **"Initialize Generation"**. The AI (`gemini-3-pro`) will enter a "Thinking" phase (approx. 5-10 seconds) to analyze, structure, and optimize your data.

## 3. Analysis & Iteration (The "Pro" Workflow)

Once generated, look at the **Strategic Alignment** panel on the left.

*   **Match Score:** A 0-100% rating of how well you fit the JD.
*   **Gap Analysis:** The AI will flag specific weaknesses (e.g., "Missing Cloud Experience").
*   **The Magic Fix:** Click the **Lightbulb Icon** next to a gap. The AI will draft a specific bullet point or skill addition to fix it. Click **"Apply Fix"** to instantly regenerate your resume with that improvement.

*Tip: Iterate this process until your Match Score exceeds 85%.*
